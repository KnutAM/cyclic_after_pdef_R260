***************************

#. Add predeformation end data and refer to full data set on Mendeley
   data. Note the sign reversal! The data included should be corrected
   wrt. torsional sign
   
   * The strains after each predeformation level (PD1,3,6)
   * The Hill yield surfaces after each predeformation level (PD1,3,6)

#. Correct sign in hdf5 data file
#. Change load angle definition in hdf5 data file 
#. Change initial dir angle in "description" field
